# Information Collector v1.0
***
<p>
 Project dedicated to collecting information in the first stages of a Pentest.
The project is not yet finished, as I am evolving it as I have time, so it will receive several updates yet.
 For now it contains only PortScan, but very soon it will receive an update that will add a brute force DNS in the complete session together with a PortScan.

## What is in the project and what will be implemented?
***
<p>
 In the list below, it will be possible to view everything that currently exists in the project and everything that I currently intend to implement.
 Within the next few days, I intend to implement a third of the brute force DNS, containing a small list of subdomains.
